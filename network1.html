      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project is a small business network built in Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal was to design a realistic,
        segmented network with basic security controls, then validate connectivity and document testing results.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="goals">
      <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Design a small business topology using switches, routers, and end devices.</li>
        <li>Segment traffic using VLANs (separate departments and guest access).</li>
        <li>Enable inter-VLAN routing and verify expected connectivity.</li>
        <li>Apply ACL rules to restrict access between VLANs while still allowing required services.</li>
        <li>Test with ping and basic troubleshooting commands to confirm the network meets requirements.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="topology">
      <h2 id="topology">Topology and Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Switching:</strong> VLANs configured on access ports, trunk links where needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Routing:</strong> Inter-VLAN routing (router-on-a-stick or Layer 3 interface) depending on the design.</li>
        <li><strong>Addressing:</strong> Separate subnet per VLAN with a default gateway per VLAN.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> ACLs to block unauthorized VLAN-to-VLAN traffic and isolate guests.</li>
      </ul>

    <section aria-labelledby="testing">
      <h2 id="testing">Testing and Validation</h2>
      <p>
        I validated the design by testing reachability within each VLAN and confirming that restricted traffic between VLANs
        was blocked as intended. Troubleshooting was done using basic router and switch commands and reviewing ACL matches.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Verified hosts can reach their default gateway and required internal resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Segmentation:</strong> Confirmed VLAN separation at Layer 2.</li>
        <li><strong>ACL policy:</strong> Confirmed blocked paths fail (expected) and allowed paths succeed (expected).</li>
        <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Used show commands (interfaces, VLANs, trunks, access-lists) to confirm configuration.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="skills">
      <h2 id="skills">Skills Demonstrated</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>VLAN planning and switch port configuration (access vs trunk)</li>
        <li>Subnetting and IP addressing</li>
        <li>Inter-VLAN routing concepts</li>
        <li>ACL design and verification (least privilege, guest isolation)</li>
        <li>Network testing and troubleshooting using structured checks</li>
      </ul>
