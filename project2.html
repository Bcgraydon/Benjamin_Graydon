      <p>
        A Java multithreaded simulation of a bank with two shared accounts and five agent types running concurrently:
        depositors, withdrawers, transfer agents, an internal auditor, and a U.S. Treasury auditor. Access to the shared
        accounts is synchronized using <code>java.util.concurrent</code> locks to ensure mutual exclusion, with withdrawing
        threads blocking when funds are insufficient and being awakened after deposits. Transfers and audits are atomic
        operations that require holding multiple account locks together; if all locks can’t be acquired immediately, those
        agents release what they hold and try again later. The simulation emphasizes proper coordination, random timing
        of events, and consistent snapshotting during audits.

      <h2 id="skills">Skills Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing cooperating, synchronized threads (producer/consumer–style patterns).</li>
        <li>Using reentrant locks, conditions (await/signal), and non-blocking <code>tryLock</code> to avoid deadlock.</li>
        <li>Coordinating atomic multi-resource operations (transfers, auditable snapshots) with lock ordering.</li>
        <li>ExecutorService with a fixed thread pool to manage agent lifecycles and pacing.</li>
        <li>Defining clear thread responsibilities and state machines for realistic simulations.</li>
