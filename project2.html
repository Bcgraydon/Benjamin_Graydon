      <p>
        A Java multithreaded simulation of a bank with two shared accounts and five agent types
        running concurrently: depositors, withdrawers, transfer agents, an internal auditor, and a
        U.S. Treasury auditor. Access is synchronized with reentrant locks and conditions; withdrawers
        block when funds are insufficient and are signaled after deposits. Transfers and audits acquire
        multiple locks together for atomic operations; if locks aren’t available, agents back off and retry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program uses a fixed thread pool to launch agents, randomized pacing to vary event timing,
        and ordered console/log output for readability and auditing snapshots.
      </p>
